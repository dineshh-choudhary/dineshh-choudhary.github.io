I'm Dinesh Choudhary, a Software Engineer at Salesforce with a solid two-year tenure at the company. Prior to joining Salesforce, I spent three years honing my skills as a Software Engineer at Flipkart. Beyond my tech career, I'm a dedicated enthusiast of financial knowledge. During my spare time, I delve into the world of finance, studying technical charts of financial instruments and seeking to expand my financial expertise. It's a blend of tech and finance that keeps me engaged and constantly learning.
